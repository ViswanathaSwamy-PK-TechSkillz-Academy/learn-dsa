# Learn Data Structures and Algorithms

I am learning Data Structures and Algorithms from different Websites, Books, and Video courses

## 1. Algorithmic Complexity Notations

### 1.1. Big Omega (Ω)

> 1. **Definition:** Big Omega notation represents the lower bound on the running time or space complexity of an algorithm.
> 1. **Purpose:** It provides information about the best-case performance of an algorithm.
> 1. **Example:** If we say an algorithm has a time complexity of Ω(n), it means that the best-case running time grows linearly with the input size.
> 1. **Use Case:** Big Omega is useful for understanding lower bounds and best-case scenarios.

### 1.2. Big Theta (Θ)

> 1. **Definition:** Big Theta notation represents both the upper and lower bounds on the running time or space complexity of an algorithm.
> 1. **Purpose:** It describes the tightest possible bound for an algorithm’s performance.
> 1. **Example:** If we say an algorithm has a time complexity of Θ(n), it means that both the best-case and worst-case running times grow linearly with the input size.
> 1. **Use Case:** Big Theta is commonly used when we want to express a precise estimate of an algorithm’s behavior.

### 1.3. Big O (O)

> 1. **Definition:** Big O notation represents the upper bound on the running time or space complexity of an algorithm.
> 1. **Purpose:** It helps us understand how an algorithm’s performance scales as the input size grows.
> 1. **Example:** If we say an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), it means that the worst-case running time grows linearly with the input size.
> 1. **Use Case:** Big O is often used to analyze the worst-case scenario.
